SciPy has a `optimize` module that includes several root-finding algorithms. One of such is the `newton` function that implements the Newton-Raphson method. The `newton` method finds a zero of the function func given a nearby starting point `x0`. The Newton-Raphson method is used if the derivative `fprime` of `func` is provided, otherwise the secant method is used. If the second order derivative `fprime2` of `func` is also provided, then Halleyâs / Newton-Raphson method is used. If `x0` is a sequence with more than one item, then newton returns an array, and `func` must be vectorized and return a sequence or array of the same shape as its first argument. If `fprime` or `fprime2` is given, then its return must also have the same shape [[9]](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.newton.html).\n",
